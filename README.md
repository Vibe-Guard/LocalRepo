# VibeGuard  

VibeGuard is a **healthcare web application** designed to help users **check symptoms, explore possible causes, remedies, treatments, lifestyle tips, and connect with doctors**. It also provides users with a personalized **health dashboard** where they can track vital health metrics, download symptom reports, and manage their profile.  

The system also includes an **Admin Panel** for managing body parts, symptoms, doctors, medicines, and users.  

Deployed live on **Render**, VibeGuard is fully **responsive** (mobile & desktop) and secure, with authentication, JWT tokens, cookies, and database-backed storage.
